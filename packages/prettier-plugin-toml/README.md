# Prettier Toml Plugin

## Try it out

## Installation

## How it works

A Prettier plugin must first parse the source code of the target language
into a traversable data structure (Usually an **A**bstract **S**yntax **T**ree)
and then print out that data structure in a "pretty" style.

Prettier-Toml uses a [Toml Parser](../parser) implemented in JavaScript using the
[Chevrotain Parser Building Toolkit for JavaScript](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain).
What this means is that unlike many other prettier plugins,
prettier-java has **no additional runtime pre-requisites** (e.g: Python executable).
It could even be used inside a browser.
